# 🧠 Kidney Disease Classification using Deep Learning

> A deep learning-based end-to-end project for detecting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) from medical data.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a **machine learning/deep learning pipeline** to classify whether a patient has **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** based on clinical parameters.

The project follows a complete workflow including:

* Data ingestion
* Data validation
* Data transformation
* Model training
* Model evaluation
* Model deployment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Framework:** Flask (for deployment)
* **Tools:** Git, Docker (optional), Jupyter Notebook
